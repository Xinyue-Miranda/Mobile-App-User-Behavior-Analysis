# Mobile-App-User-Behavior-Analysis

## Overview
This is a simple EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project on backend data from a mobile app (using R, especially the ‘tidyverse’ package). I analyzed user activity data for a mobile app based on customer goals, including cleaning and reformatting datasets, linking and merging data with relational databases and performing statistical significance analysis.

## Background
Actify is a mobile app aiming at helping its user develop a healthy lifestyle. An important feature of this app is user can create personal daily tasks and set reminders to organize them. During this project, we want to give the app developer some strategies for improving their product by analyzing the relationship between customer stickiness and their activities related to reminders.

## Data
We have three datasets in this project. First, the backend data of the mobile app tracking every event user involved with the app. Second, the user information data, where the usernames are encrypted. Third, a decryption table which matches each encrypted username with that appeared in the backend data.

## Methodologies
1) Cleaning and merging the datasets
2) Exploratory data analysis and visualization

## Results
Half of the users who have rejected the reminders will remove the app, and most of them will remove it quickly. Probably they found the reminder function is not useful to them to set up a healthier habit. We then share the finding with the mobile app developer and help them get some intuitions on how to improve user engagement with a better reminder mechanism.
